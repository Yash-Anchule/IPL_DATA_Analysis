As a passionate IPL fan, I’ve always been fascinated by team performances, player stats, and match trends. This season, I decided to put my data skills to the test and dive deep into IPL data analysis!

🔍 Project Overview:
I sourced IPL datasets from Kaggle, cleaned and transformed them using Power Query in Excel, and further refined the data with PySpark & Pandas for better structure and consistency. Finally, I leveraged Power BI for interactive visualizations, using DAX queries and extensive data modeling to extract valuable insights.

📊 Key Insights & Focus Areas:
✅ Overall IPL Performance Overview using Power BI dashboards
✅ In-depth Team Analysis for Mumbai Indians, KKR, RCB, and Chennai Super Kings
✅ Batsmen & Bowler Insights – Identifying top performers and hidden trends
✅ Data Relationships & Trends – Uncovering key factors affecting team success

This project was an incredible learning experience, combining data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and storytelling to derive meaningful cricket insights. It was amazing to see how data can uncover patterns that might go unnoticed by just watching the matches!

I have attached all the files that have been used or created hope you will like the project
